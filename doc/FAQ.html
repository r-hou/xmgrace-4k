<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="#toc1.1">What is Grace?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Grace is a tool to make two-dimensional plots of numerical
data. It runs under various (if not all) flavours of UNIX
with X11 and M*tif. Its capabilities are roughly similar to
GUI-based programs like Sigmaplot or Microcal Origin plus
script-based tools like gnuplot or Genplot.  Its strength
lies in the fact that it combines the convenience of a
graphical user interface with the power of a scripting
language which enables it to do sophisticated calculations
or perform automated tasks.</P>
<P>Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally
written by Paul Turner.</P>
<P>From version number 4.00, the development was taken over by
a team of volunteers under the coordination of Evgeny Stambulchik.</P>
<P>When its copyright was changed to GPL, the name was changed to Grace,
which stands for ``GRaphing, Advanced Computation and Exploration of
data'' or ``Grace Revamps ACE/gr''. The first version of Grace
available is named 5.0.0, while the last public version of Xmgr has
the version number 4.1.2.</P>
<P>Paul still maintains and develops a non-public version of
Xmgr for internal use.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="#toc1.2">Where can I get Grace?       </A>
</H2>


<P>You can get the newest information about Grace and download
the latest version at the 
<A HREF="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Grace           home page</A>.</P>
<P>You can fetch it from a mirror site as well. The list of
mirror sites can be found at 
<A HREF="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/MIRRORS">ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/MIRRORS</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="homepage"></A> <A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="#toc1.3">Where can I get the most recent information about Grace?            </A>
      </H2>


<P>Please refer to the 
<A HREF="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">official Grace Home Page</A>. There you
can also find the latest version of this FAQ, links to the
latest release and to mirror sites closer to you.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4</A> <A HREF="#toc1.4">What is the difference between Xmgr and Grace?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Apart from the licensing, the main difference is that Grace is
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). This was achieved through a
major rewrite of all the mid-level drawing routines and the use of
the device-independent Type 1 font rendering library T1lib for
typesetting.</P>
<P>For help with changing from Xmgr to Grace see section 
<CODE>Xmgr to Grace migration guide</CODE> in the
User's Guide (question 
<A HREF="#manual">User's Guide</A>.</P>
<P>There are currently several features of Xmgr which are not yet
implemented in Grace (of course, alongside with a lot of new stuff
not found in Xmgr). A full compatibility is desirable except for
``bad'' features of Xmgr.</P>

<P>Among the Xmgr features not (yet) implemented in Grace are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>X-Y graph flip
</LI>
<LI>Horizontal and vertical lines as symbols
</LI>
<LI>Smith plots
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5</A> <A HREF="#toc1.5">Why did you change the name?       </A>
</H2>


<P>When the licensing was changed to GPL, Paul wanted to keep
the name for his non-public version of Xmgr, so we chose a
new name.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6</A> <A HREF="#toc1.6">Is Grace free?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Yes. Grace is free in terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL) (see the file <CODE>LICENSE</CODE> which comes with

<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>First</B><DD>
<P>Make sure that what you found really is a bug.</P>

<DT><B>Second</B><DD>
<P>Try to make sure that it is a bug in Grace,
and that the failure is not caused by another piece of
software.</P>

<DT><B>Third</B><DD>
<P>Make sure you are running the latest official
release of Grace. The development of Grace is
rather fast, so your bug might already be fixed.</P>

<DT><B>Fourth</B><DD>
<P>Try to find out if the bug is already known
(see question 
<A HREF="#w3todo">Known Bugs</A>).</P>

<DT><B>Fifth</B><DD>
<P>OK: You <EM>have</EM> found a new bug. Use
<B>w3todo</B> (question 
<A HREF="#w3todo">Known             Bugs</A>) to report it. Follow the instructions on the
page and try to be as precise as possible. It won't be of
much help if you write ``The program crashes.'' Try to
find a simple reproducible case. Mention the version of
Grace and where you got the build and the operating system
you use. You should submit the system info as provided by
``uname -a'' (if this utility exists, of course) and the output
of ``xmgrace -version''. Often the problem is related to
some specific data set. Please try hard on reducing this
to the minimum which is sufficient of reproducing the
bug. If it's only a few lines of data please submit
it together with the other details.
Once you submit the bug report, it will be automatically
relayed to the mailing list. You will usually be notified when
the bug is fixed or if we need more information, so please
don't forget to give your correct e-mail address.</P>

<P>Yes. You can search and browse the database of known bugs in
Grace at the bug report facility 
<A HREF="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/w3todo/index.phtml">w3todo</A>
or using the <CODE>"Help/Comments"</CODE> menu from within
Grace.  The database also keeps track of the status of the
bug (<CODE>Confirmed, Working on, Testing, Fixed, Closed,</CODE>

<P>You must have missed something very obvious. Check out how to
properly submit a bug report in this document. Most probably your

<P>You can submit wishes and suggestions just the way you would
submit bug reports (see question 
<A HREF="#w3todo">Known Bugs</A>).  Suggestions for improvement are
generally very welcome. It may be possible, however, that
the developers are busy or that your wish is rejected for
some good reason, so it may be necessary to persuade (better
convince) them to get at it.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6</A> <A HREF="#toc3.6">I want to help! How can I contribute to Grace?       </A>

<P>Fine! There are always things to do.</P>
<P>If you are a C programmer, you can almost certainly find
something useful to do. Just ask on the forums.
The same applies if you are a technical writer. The documentation
will certainly need to be updated, corrected or completed.

<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="#toc4">Installation     </A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="install"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="#toc4.1">How do I install Grace? </A>
      </H2>


<P>You have the choice: either you compile the sources yourself
or you download precompiled binaries (we strongly suggest you take
the first route). You can get both from
the 
<A HREF="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Grace Home Page</A>. Whether binaries for your platforms
are available (see question 
<A HREF="#binaries">Binaries</A>)
depends on whether one of the developers
has access to the respective platform and has had time to do
it.</P>
<P>It is always a good idea to read the <CODE>README</CODE>s that accompany
the downloading packages of Grace.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="#toc4.2">Can I compile Grace myself?       </A>
</H2>

<P>Yes! Actually, this is the preferred method of installation.
After getting the sources (question 
<A HREF="#install">Installation</A>) and un<CODE>gzip</CODE>ping and un<CODE>tar</CODE>ing
them (use e.g. <CODE>gzip -dc grace-5.0.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -</CODE>),
proceed according to the relevant section of the
<A HREF="#manual">User's Guide</A>, which covers the compilation
process.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="#toc4.3">When I run `configure', it says the XXX package is not found,            whereas I am certain it was installed on my system!       </A>
</H2>

<P>There are several possible reasons:
<UL>
<LI>You have only the run-time part installed (this especially
concerns GNU/Linux users). However, you should have the
relevant development package (C header files etc) installed, too.
E.g., for the JPEG library to be recognized by `configure',
<I>both</I> <CODE>libjpeg62</CODE> and <CODE>libjpeg62-devel</CODE>
packages must be installed.</LI>
<LI>The library and the header files don't match each other (they are
from  different versions). This usually happens on large Unix
systems with a less than capable sysadmin...</LI>
<LI>Either the library or the header files can't be found by the
compiler. Use the <CODE>--with-extra-ldpath</CODE> and
<CODE>--with-extra-incpath</CODE> configure options to provide the
extra paths, respectively.</LI>

</H2>


<P>Check whether M*tif (question 
<A HREF="#motif">M*tif</A>) is installed on your system. If it is, look
at the file config.log: there is a line like this:</P>
<P><CODE>configure:8900: checking for a Motif &gt;= 1002 compatible API</CODE></P>
<P>What comes directly after it? Could be a hint. Also, see the previous
question.</P>

<H2><A NAME="motif"></A> <A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="#toc4.5">What is Motif (LessTif)? </A>
      </H2>


<P>Throughout the Grace docs, saying "M*tif" we actually refer to
the Motif <I>API</I>, defining a set of functions for building
graphical user interfaces (GUI) via numerous widgets
(buttons, labels, etc). Grace makes a heavy use of the M*tif API. </P>
<P>There are several <I>implementations</I> of the interface. The
original OSF Motif (see 
<A HREF="http://www.opengroup.org">http://www.opengroup.org</A>)
recently changed its license: on open-source platforms you
may have a chance to use it for free, although it's not in general
qualified as either a FreeSource or OpenSource product.</P>
<P>There is, however, a free replacement for Motif called LessTif (see
<A HREF="http://www.lesstif.org">http://www.lesstif.org</A>). LessTif is intended to be a 100%
source compatible replacement for Motif, but is still under
development. For the purposes of Grace, try using the latest version
of LessTif (at least 0.92.6 and above). The LessTif people usually
receive many bug reports from the Grace developers, so you might hope
that a few remaining bugs in LessTif will be fixed rather quickly.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6</A> <A HREF="#toc4.6">`configure' stops telling it can't find "ar".       </A>
</H2>


<P>"ar" is the library archiver (the program used to create static
libraries like libFoo.a). You should have it in your path. Under
Solaris, for example, this can be found in /usr/ccs/bin.</P>

<H2><A NAME="binaries"></A> <A NAME="ss4.7">4.7</A> <A HREF="#toc4.7">Are there Grace binaries available? For which platforms?            </A>

<P>We do not officially support binary packages. When contributed by
volunteers they're put in under the 
<A HREF="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/contrib/">contrib</A> area. Again,
these are NOT supported (bug reports like "I can't install that RPM"
will be silently ignored), but feel free using the Grace forums

<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8</A> <A HREF="#toc4.8">Is there a Windows|OS/2|VMS port of Grace?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Yes, Grace runs on VMS. Just compile it there.</P>
<P>As for Win32 (Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP) and OS/2, there are ports for
these platforms, though they are not "native", i.e. in order to run
them, one needs an X server for the respective platform.</P>
<P>Both OS/2 and Win32 ports may lack some of the functionality (notably,
support for "direct"/native printing; probably you will have to use
the Postscript output for printing).</P>
<P>A port to OS/2 made by Alexander Mai can be found
at 
<A HREF="http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/">http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/~st002279/os2/</A>.
It requires the XFree86 libraries and an X Server (e.g. XFree86,
Hob X11, Exceed, etc.).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="#toc5.1">When I start Grace I get the message            ``Can't find library libXXX.so'' or similar.       </A>
</H2>


<P>For certain tasks, Grace needs external libraries which are
neither provided by Grace nor the operating system. You will
need to install these libraries yourself. This applies to
M*tif, PDF (see question 
<A HREF="#export">Output Devices</A>)
and probably other libraries.
If the message is exactly <CODE>Can't find library libXm.so</CODE>
(usually this happens on GNU/Linux systems ...) then you don't have
M*tif (the Xm libraries) installed (see question
<A HREF="#motif">M*tif</A>), or the linker doesn't
know where it is.
In the first case, try downloading LessTif. In the second case,
you have to tell your linker  where it is (may be
a platform-specific task). On GNU/Linux look at the file
<CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>. It  contains pathnames of the directories
where dynamic libraries are stored. Add (as root) your directory
to this file and run <CODE>ldconfig -v</CODE>. Now the libraries
should be in the list. If you're not root you may try
to adjust the environment variable <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>
to include the required pathname.</P>
<P>For some versions of Motif, the ``soname'' (which
identifies the version of the library and is stored
somewhere in the library) on your computer doesn't match
the soname of the library on the computer where your copy
of Grace was compiled on. Then you should use a
(semi)statically linked version or compile Grace on your
computer.</P>

<P>This means that Grace made an incorrect access to an X
library. This is most probably not Grace's fault. Probably a
not-yet-correctly-implemented LessTif function (see question
<A HREF="#motif">M*tif</A>) caused this behaviour. If you
use LessTif, try to get the latest version (see question

number. Julian Date 0 is a day way in the past, namely the
1st January 4713 before Christ (don't ask me why). The
following days are numbered sequentially, each day starting
at noon.
This numbering scheme is in wide use, especially in
astronomy, and is used for the internal representation of
dates in Grace. Some further explanations are given on
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">this page</A>.</P>
<P>The <CODE>convcal</CODE> utility in <CODE>$GRACE_HOME/auxiliary/</CODE> can

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="#toc7.1">How do I start Grace?       </A>

<P>There are three ways to invoke Grace. The full-featured

      </H2>


<P><CODE>gracebat</CODE> is simply a copy of Grace named <CODE>gracebat</CODE>
or a symbolic link from <CODE>gracebat</CODE> to Grace. In the case
of the symbolic link:</P>
<P><CODE>ln -s xmgrace gracebat</CODE></P>
<P>done wherever the Grace binary is located will do the trick
(rehash or logout and login to make sure that <CODE>gracebat</CODE>
shows up in your path). Executing <CODE>gracebat</CODE> with no
command line parameters or data files will produce a
hardcopy on the default printer.</P>

</H2>


<P>Use two overlaying graphs, one with a scale on the

can achieve the desired effect, but you'll need to pay
close attention to which graph is the 'current'

<H2><A NAME="ss7.9">7.9</A> <A HREF="#toc7.9">How do I do polar plots?       </A>

<P>Yes, Grace has all these features. Wherever you can type a
text in Grace, e.g. Axis labels, graph title, text from
<CODE>Plot->Drawing objects</CODE>, etc., you can use all those
features within the same text.  Please refer to the User

</H2>


<P>If you asked this question, then you are probably familiar with
the issue of keymap modifying in X. Once you configured the key
mapping (with the use of <CODE>xmodmap</CODE>), you can enter the
extended characters from the keyboard in any text input field. If,
in addition, the appropriate for your language font encoding is
anything but ISO Latin1 (used in most Western Europe countries),
you'll have to tell Grace so. See the
<A HREF="#fonts">next question</A>.</P>

      </H2>


<P>Yes. Starting with version 5.0.1, you can use your own
fonts, in addition to the standard 14 fonts which
include Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier, Symbols and Zapf
Dingbats and come with Grace, and as a replacement for the
default fonts (for the purporse of localization). As well,
an alternative encoding scheme can be specified.</P>

</H2>


<P>By default, numbers are saved with eight valid digits. To
set your own precision, use the command</P>
<P><CODE>DEFAULT SFORMAT formatstring</CODE></P>
<P>in an init resource file (see question 
<A HREF="#custom">Customization</A>) with formatstring being in the
<CODE>printf(3)</CODE> format.</P>
<P>As well, you can set the precision on a per-project basis. When you
save a project for the first time (or use "File/Save as"), there is
a relevant "Data format" field in the popup you are presented with.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.14">7.14</A> <A HREF="#toc7.14">When I save a project and then re-open it, the Julian date values            appear to be rounded to the nearest half day.       </A>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.15">7.15</A> <A HREF="#toc7.15">How do I read in project files created by Xmgr?       </A>
</H2>


<P>From Xmgr-4.1.2 on, each project file starts with a string
giving the version number by which is was saved. These
files should cause no problems. You can modify older files
by inserting a version line at the beginning. For example,
<CODE>@VERSION 40102</CODE> stands for version 4.1.2. If you have no
idea what version of Xmgr your file was created with, try some.
In most cases, 40102 would do the trick. Also, make sure to read
the "Xmgr to Grace migration" section of the User's Guide
(question 
<A HREF="#manual">User's Guide</A>).</P>

</H2>


<P>In Xmgr-4.1.0, support for the binary file format (the
former default one) was dropped. You must use the
<CODE>grconvert</CODE> utility supplied with the Grace
distribution in order to convert the files. This can
easily be achieved defining an input filter like in the
<CODE>gracerc</CODE> sample file which comes with Grace.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.18">7.18</A> <A HREF="#toc7.18">How do I save disk space? Can I use compressed project files?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Yes. You can use your favorite compression program
(e.g. `gzip') as input or output filter so that files on
disk are automagically (de)compressed. Just add the lines</P>
<P><CODE>DEFINE IFILTER "gzip -dc %s" PATTERN "*.gz"</CODE></P>
<P>and</P>
<P><CODE>DEFINE OFILTER "gzip - &gt;  %s" PATTERN "*.gz"</CODE></P>
<P>into your personal grace init file. Then, everytime you
specify a file name that ends with <CODE>.gz</CODE>, gzip is used
as input and output filters. You can use this mechanism to
do other things, e.g. reading and storing files into a
database.</P>

PostScript; for the inclusion of graphics into e.g. LaTeX
documents), PNM (PBM/PGM/PPM), MIF (for inclusion in
FrameMaker) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
are implemented by default.</P>
<P>Additionally, if some extra libraries are installed, listed in the
User's Guide (question 
<A HREF="#manual">User's Guide</A>),
the JPEG, PNG, and PDF backends will be built as well.</P>
<P>You can get various other formats using netpbm and pstoedit.</P>
<P>Bitmaps: Using the PNM device + the <CODE>netpbm</CODE> utils
(available at e.g. 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/">ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/</A> one can get
TIFF, GIF, G3, BMP, PCX,...  (conversion can be done on
the fly with appropriate filter definitions).</P>
<P>Notice that the direct support of the GIF format is impossible
due to the copyright policy of Unisys - it's not a technical
problem. In fact it was supported in earlier versions but
to avoid any legal problems this feature has been removed.</P>
<P>One can use 
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Network/1958/pstoedit/">pstoedit</A>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.21">7.21</A> <A HREF="#toc7.21">Where have all the region operations gone to?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Region operations have no meaning by themselves. Regions are
restriction conditions applied to data set(s) which a
transformation is performed on. For example, to kill data points in
a region, use "Evaluate expression", select same source and dest

Make sure, however, that the time fields don't contain space
separators inside, e.g. 1999-12-31-23:59:59.5</P>
<P>Also, you can use an external program to convert the data into the

<P>A named pipe is a pseudo file to which one application
writes data which another one reads from it.</P>
<P>Applications like measurement programs can write data to a
pipe and make it thus available to Grace which reads from
the pipe. So Grace can serve as data displayer for otherwise
non-graphical programs.</P>
<P>Refer to the User's Guide (question

<P>You're using a localized version of OS. You have either LANG or

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1</A> <A HREF="#toc9.1">Which non-interactive batch commands does Grace know?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Lots. Almost every mouseclick in the GUI has an equivalent
in the batch language. See the User's Guide (question 
<A HREF="#manual">User's Guide</A>) for details.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2</A> <A HREF="#toc9.2">How can I do feature extraction non-interactively?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Currently not at all. This will be implemented in a later
release.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="#toc9.3">How can I use non-linear fits in the batch mode?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Example - make a batch file with the following commands:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
          fit formula "y = a0 + a1 * sin (a2 + x * pi / 180)"
          fit with 3 parameters
          fit prec 0.05
          a0 = 1
          a0 constraints on
          a0min = 0
          a0max = 2
          a1 = 1
          a1 constraints off
          a2 = 1
          a2 constraints off
          nonlfit (s0, 100)
        
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This assumes that your original curve is in set s0 and that
you want to make 100 iterations.</P>
<P><CODE>nonlfit()</CODE> doesn't produce any plots by itself. It only
<B>fits</B>. I.e., at this point, you can use the fitted
values <CODE>A0, A1, A2...</CODE>:</P>
<P>Plot a set, e.g.:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
          s3 on
          s3 length s0.length
          s3.x = s0.x
          s3.y = a0 + a1 * sin (a2 + x * pi / 180)
        
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Use for another fit as the initial values, or just ECHO them
(to <CODE>stdout</CODE>) with <CODE>ECHO A0</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4</A> <A HREF="#toc9.4">Is it possible to call the command "POINT expr, expr" with more            than two values, as needed, for example, for points in XYDYDY            sets?       </A>
</H2>

<P>No, but you can do something like this (given the set type was
properly defined):</P>
<P>
<PRE>
          S0 POINT expr, expr
          S0.Y1[S0.LENGTH - 1] = expr
          S0.Y2[S0.LENGTH - 1] = expr
          ...

<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="#toc10.1">Does Grace have an UNDO function?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Not yet. Although it would be nice to have such a
function, it is quite hard to implement. We can only ask you
to be careful with certain actions and remember to <CODE>save
often and early (TM)</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="#toc10.2">Can Grace plot 3D graphs?       </A>
</H2>


<P>No. Not yet, I should say. Be patient. It may take quite a
while to implement it, though.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3</A> <A HREF="#toc10.3">Which features are planned for the future?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Among the many features planned to be introduced in the
future are enhancing the spreadsheet-like frontend for dataset
operations, contour plots, many-level undo/redo, image import and
manipulations, a library for 2-way communication, ... Then 3D plots
would come :-)</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.4">10.4</A> <A HREF="#toc10.4">Are there things that Grace can't do?       </A>
</H2>


<P>Probably. If you have an idea for improvement, post it as a wish to
the w3todo web page (see question 
<A HREF="#w3todo">Known Bugs</A>).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.5">10.5</A> <A HREF="#toc10.5">How should Grace be acknowledged when it            is used to prepare a publication?       </A>
